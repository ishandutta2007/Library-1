了解しました。競技プログラミングライブラリのドキュメント改善タスクを開始します。ファイル `md/Internal/long_traits.md` が選択されました。これより、関連ファイルの確認とドキュメントの改善案の検討に移ります。`src/Internal/long_traits.hpp` exists. Now reading `md/Internal/long_traits.md` and `src/Internal/long_traits.hpp`, then finding tests that include it.Okay, `md/Internal/long_traits.md` is simple. Now, `src/Internal/long_traits.hpp`.Okay, I've reviewed `src/Internal/long_traits.hpp` and see `make_long_t<T>` is a type trait for widening types. Now, I'll find its usage in test files to understand its application and determine if documentation needs updating.`grep` found no files including `Internal/long_traits.hpp` in `test/`. Since it's an internal helper, it's likely tested indirectly. I'll now search the entire `src/` directory for its includes to understand its usage.`src/Internal/long_traits.hpp` is included in `KDTree.hpp`, `Point.hpp`, and `PiecewiseLinearConvex.hpp`. I'll check `Point.hpp` first to see how `make_long_t` is used, as it's fundamental to the geometry library and likely uses `long long` to prevent overflow.`Point.hpp`'s `dot` and `cross` functions use `make_long_t<K>` to prevent overflow by extending `int` results to `long long`. The current `long_traits.md` documentation is insufficient, lacking this crucial context. I will update it to explain the purpose of `make_long_t` for overflow prevention, provide the `Point` cross product as a concrete example, and detail the supported type conversions.Documentation fixed. Now, setting `GITHUB_ENV`: `TARGET_FILE` is `md/Internal/long_traits.md`, `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY` is "Expanded `make_long_t` documentation with purpose and examples."I've completed the documentation improvement for `md/Internal/long_traits.md`. I randomly selected the file, analyzed its corresponding header and its inclusion in `src/Geometry/Point.hpp`, and then updated the documentation to include the purpose of `make_long_t` (overflow prevention), a concrete cross-product example, and a detailed type conversion table. Finally, I set the `TARGET_FILE` and `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY` in `GITHUB_ENV` as requested. All tasks are complete.File check complete. Work finished.
